# LyX layout for JLReq document classes
LyX layout for the *jlreq* LaTeX document class

This is a LyX layout file for the *jlreq* LaTeX document class. LyX is a document processor available at https://www.lyx.org/. *jlreq* is a LaTeX document class which implements the standard of *Requirements for Japanese Text Layout* set by W3C and available at https://github.com/abenori/jlreq.

## Install
1. Copy files in the **layouts** directory to `LYXDIR/layouts/`
2. Copy files in the **examples** directory to `LYXDIR/examples/Articles/`
3. Run LyX
4. Choose menu **Tools -> Reconfigure**

The place of LYXDIR depends on OS's. Most likely places are:
- `/usr/local/share/lyx` or `/usr/share/lyx` on UN\*X-like systems including Linux,
- `C:\Program Files\LyX` on Windows, 
- `/Applications/LyX/Contents/Resources` on MacOS.
